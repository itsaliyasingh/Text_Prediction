# Text_Prediction
In this program, the complete_sentence function sends a prompt (the user's sentence) to the GPT-3.5 model using the OpenAI API. The model generates a completion for the prompt, and the completed sentence is extracted from the API response. The completed sentence is then returned and displayed as output.
